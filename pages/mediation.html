                            approximately one billion followers, Hinduism is the world’s third largest religion by
                            population, and the majority religion in India, Nepal and Bali (Indonesia). Hinduism("The

                            A mantra is a syllable or word that is repeated for the purpose of focusing your mind.
                            Its very important, due to the “vibration” associated to the sound and meaning, and that
                            for this reason an initiation into it is essential.<br>
                            Mantras are used in Hindu traditions, Buddhist traditions (especially Tibetan and “Pure
                            Land” Buddhism), as well as in Jainism, Sikhism and Daoism (Taoism). Some people call
                            mantra meditation “om meditation”, but that is just one of the mantras that can be used.
                            A more devotion oriented practice of mantras is called japa, and consists of repeating
                            sacred sounds (name of God) with love.
                            <p>
                                How to do it<br>

                                As most type of meditations, it is usually practiced sitting with spine erect, and
                                eyes closed. The practitioner then repeats the mantra in his mind, silently, over
                                and over again during the whole session.
                                Sometimes this practice is coupled with being aware of the breathing or coordinating
                                with it.<br>
                                As you repeat the mantra, it creates a mental vibration that allows the mind to
                                experience deeper levels of awareness. As you meditate, the mantra becomes
                                increasingly abstract and indistinct, until you’re finally led into the field of
                                pure consciousness from which the vibration arose. Repetition of the mantra helps you disconnect from the thoughts filling your mind so that perhaps you may slip into the gap between thoughts.<br> <span>Mantras can be viewed as  ancient power words with subtle intentions that help us connect to spirit, the source of everything in the universe. </span>

                            ranscendental Meditation is a specific form of Mantra Meditation introduced by Maharishi
                            Mahesh Yogi in 1955 in India and the West.
                            There is a lot of scientific research, sponsored by the organization, demonstrating the
                            benefits of the practice.
                            It is known that TM involves the use of a mantra and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice
                            per day while sitting with one’s eyes closed. The mantra is not unique, and is given to the
                            practitioner based on his gender and age. The Mantro is are Tantric names of Hindu deities.
                            Practice under intrustor and it's licensed.

                            There is not one type of meditation which is “Yogic Meditation”. Yoga means “union”.
                            Tradition goes as far as 1700 B.C, and has as its highest goal spiritual purification and
                            Self-Knowledge. Classical Yoga divides the practice into rules of conduct ( yamas and
                            niyamas ), physical postures ( asanas ), breathing exercises ( pranayama ), and
                            contemplative practices of meditation ( pratyahara , dharana , dhyana , samadhi ).

                                        third eye” or “ ajna chakra” ) . The attention is constantly redirected to this
                                        point, as a means to silence the mind. By time the “silent gaps” between
                                        thoughts get wider and deeper. Sometimes this is accompanied by physically
                                        “looking”, with eyes closed, towards that spot.</p>

                            Self-Enquiry is "atma vichara". It means to “investigate” our true nature, to find the
                            answer to the “Who am I?” It was expanded upon by the 20th-century Indian sage Ramana
                            Maharshi (1879~1950).<br><br>
                            The modern non-duality movement (or neo-advaita ), which is greatly inspired in his
                            teachings – as well as those of Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897~1981) and Papaji – strongly uses this technique and variations.<br><br>

                            How to do it<br>

                            Your sense of “I” (or “ego”) is the center of your universe. It is there behind all your
                            thoughts, emotions, memories, and perceptions. Yet we are not clear about what this “I” is –
                            about who we truly are, in essence – and confuse it with our body, our mind, our roles, our
                            labels. It’s the biggest mystery in our lives.<br>

                            With Self-Enquiry, the question “Who I am?” is asked within yourself. Use this question
                            simply as a tool to fix your attention in the subjective feeling of “I” or “I am”. Become
                            one with it, go deep into it. This will then reveal your true “I”, your real self as pure
                            consciousness, beyond all limitation. It is not an intellectual pursuit, but a question to
                            bring the attention to the core element of your perception and experience: the “I”. This is
                            not your personality, but a pure, subjective, feeling of existing – without any images or
                            concepts attached to it.<br>
                            Whenever thoughts/feelings arise, you ask yourself, “To whom does this arise?” or “Who is
                            aware of _____ (anger, fear, pain, or whatever)?” The answer will be “It’s me!”. From then
                            you ask “Who am I?”, to bring the attention back to the subjective feeling of self, of
                            presence. It is pure existence, objectless and choice-less awareness.
